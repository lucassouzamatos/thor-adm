# Speed up the consensus cycle as fast as it will go.
# If clock desynchronisation is an issue, increase these voting times.

# V3AuthVotingInterval and TestingV3AuthInitialVotingInterval can be:
#   10, 12, 15, 18, 20, ...
# TestingV3AuthInitialVotingInterval can also be:
#    5, 6, 8, 9
# They both need to evenly divide 24 hours.

# Initial Vote + Initial Dist must be less than Initial Interval
#
# Mixed 0.3.3 and 0.3.4 networks are unstable, due to timing changes.
# When all 0.3.3 and earlier versions are obsolete, we may be able to revert to

# Vote + Dist must be less than Interval/2, because when there's no consensus,
